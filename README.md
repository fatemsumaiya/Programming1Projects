# Programming1Projects
Projects I have done in CMP 167: Introduction to Java. This includes building a chatbot using objects and a calculator using loops and if-else statements.  

# Calculator:
After learning loops and if-else statement in Java, I created a calculator using a do-while loop in my main frame, ensuring the calculator repeats itselfs unless the user
chooses to exit. Within this loop, I incorporated logic to check whether the user inputs "standard" or "scientific" mode, directing the program to the appropriate method accordingly.

# Eliza
Learning the basics of Object-Oriented-Programming, I embarked on a new journey of creating a chatBot. Ever need a listening ear? Eliza is for you. Eliza asks about your day 
and will always want to know more about your thoughts and feelings.
